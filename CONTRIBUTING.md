# Contributing

This is a minimal "shitty version" implementation for educational purposes. Contributions are welcome, but keep in mind the philosophy:

## Philosophy

- **Keep it simple**: This is meant to be a weekend project, not production code
- **Prove the concept**: Focus on demonstrating the core idea, not perfect implementation
- **Document limitations**: Be honest about what's "shitty" and why

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Submit a pull request

## Areas for Improvement

- Better hyperparameter tuning
- More robust planning strategies
- Additional visualization tools
- Performance optimizations
- Better error handling

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where helpful
- Add docstrings to functions
- Keep functions focused and small
